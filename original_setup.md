# Original Setup

This document outlines notes on the original setup by Aidan.

* Clone playn and tripleplay from the threerings github page and install them locally to maven.
* Make sure to have maven set to use Java 1.7 or tripleplay won't build.
* Set the environmental variable MAVEN_OPTS if you want to change the jetty port.
